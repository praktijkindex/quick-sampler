    class << self

      # Main entry point of Quick Sampler. Compiles a definition into a sampler. The
      # "compilation" is only a metaphor here, since definition - which is given to `compile` as
      # a block - is simply executed in the context of a fresh {Quick::Sampler::DSL}
      # instance (where available syntax can be found).
      #
      # @example Compile a sampler
      #   chaos = Quick::Sampler.compile description: "a bit of everything" do
      #     one_of_weighted integer => 5,
      #                     boolean => 1,
      #                     pick_from(-10.0..10.0) => 10,
      #                     string(:alnum) => 15,
      #                     feed { Faker::Internet.email } => 3
      #   end
      #
      # @param [String] description sampler description which
      #   will be returned by `#inspect` as well as `#description`
      #
      # @param block sampler definition. Will be `instance_eval`ed in the context of an
      #   anonymous instance of {Quick::Sampler::DSL}.
